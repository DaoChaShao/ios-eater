**INTRODUCTION**  
This application is a straightforward tool that helps people decide what to eat when confused. The purpose of creating the application is to familiarise myself with the process of building an application and the basic architecture of an IOS application.
- The application was developed using Xcode 16.2 and downloaded from the official App Store.
- If you plan to use the [SF Symbols (version 6.0)](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/), you can download it directly from the official website. It will be an independent application that occurs on your Mac instead of updating the Xcode function.

**CODING ASSISTANT**  
Due to the lack of a format function for Xcode, you can use the formatting extension if you like.
- The formate tool of Xcode is named `SwiftFormat`.
- Find it on the [GitHub](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) of Nick Lockwood.
- Download the application via [releases](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/releases). There is `SwiftFormat.for.Xcode.app.zip`.
- Unzip it and put it into your application file.
- Enable it via the Mac general settings, the extension part.
- Restart the Xcode.
- Find it in the `Editor` menu, that last one.
- Set the shortcut key for `format file`.
