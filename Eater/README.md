**INTRODUCTION**  
This application is a straightforward tool that helps people decide what to eat when confused. The purpose of creating the application is to familiarise myself with the process of building an application and the basic architecture of an IOS application.
- The application was developed using Xcode 16.2 and downloaded from the official App Store.
- If you plan to use the [SF Symbols (version 6.0)](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/), you can download it directly from the official website. It will be an independent application that occurs on your Mac instead of updating the Xcode function.
